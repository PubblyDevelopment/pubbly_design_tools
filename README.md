# Pubbly design tools

A livecode cross platform application to create pubbly brand export files

## Getting Started

### Designers

To start using the pubbly design tools to create content, download the windows or Mac packages, extract or install, and launch the application.

Pubbly can also work on a linux machine through Wine, but this is mostly untested.

For help on how to create content, read through the applications built in help menu, specifically the Terms and Concepts.

### Developers

To start editing the source code of the Pubbly Design Tools, first download a copy of [LveCode Community 7.1.4](https://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/). Download and unzip the Window.zip package, and rename the file Tools.pbly to Tools.livecode. Open the Tools file from within Livecode.

Changes must be done from within the Livecode IDE.
